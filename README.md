Pass in a series of composer projects (can be drupal or otherwise) and this will build a project base from them and provided you a downloadable composer link

## Example

```
kickstart-backend.acromedia.com/?projects[]=drupal/commerce&products[]=drupal/commerce_reports
```

This will return a simple link to a tar of the composer.json plus helper scripts
